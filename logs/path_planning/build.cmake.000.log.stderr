[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/billliu/trials/volans/src/sup/path_planning/path_planning/CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOMPL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OMPL", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OMPL" with any of
  the following names:

    OMPLConfig.cmake
    ompl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OMPL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OMPL_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "OMPL"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
